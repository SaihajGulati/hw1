list.txt is used to test my code for split
You can input any numbers in it and a linked list is created from the file that is then tested

To compile (or at least the way I did if needed for reference):
```c++
g++ -g -Wall -std=c++11 ulliststr.cpp ulliststr_test.cpp -o test

```

To run (or at least the way I did if needed for reference):
```
./test
```
